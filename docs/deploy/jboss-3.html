<HR>
This guide will serve as a quick and dirty way to get Cayambe running on your JBoss 3 server.<BR>
We assume that you already have a JBoss 3 server with either Tomcat or Jetty and a mySQL server runnning.<BR>
<BR>
There are five major steps to getting Cayambe running:
<LI>Download Cayambe
<LI>Download Dependencies
<LI>Setup the Database
<LI>Deploy Dependencies
<LI>Deploy Cayambe Ear
<BR><BR>
<B>Download Cayambe</B><BR>
<BR>
The latest release of Cayambe can be found at SourceForge in our <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8195">File Repository</A>.  Download the version and file type that best suits your needs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Download Dependencies</B><BR>
<BR>
Our Current Dependency list:<BR>
<LI>Struts 1.1 (<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/release/">download latest here</A>) *** You can just get the lib release ***
<LI>mm.mysql JDBC Driver (<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mmmysql/">download latest here</A>)
<BR><BR>
<B>Setup the Database</B><BR>
<BR>
This guide assumes that you have created a user and database for Cayambe.<BR>
In your Cayambe release there should be a SQL dir.  That dir contains the sql scripts we will use.<BR>
You can run the mysql.sql to create the tables.<BR>
After the tables have been successfully created you can run the test_data.sql to load the tables with test data.<BR>
<BR>
In order for Cayambe to know how to talk to the database, we need to setup a new mySQL ConnectionManager in JBoss.<BR>
Modify the ConnectionURL, UserName, and Password in the mysql-service.xml file in the sql dir to fit your setup.<BR>
Copy that file into your deploy dir.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Deploy Dependencies</B><BR>
<BR>
Copy all the commons*.jar tiles.jar and struts.jar files into your deploy dir.<BR>
Copy the mm.mysql driver to your deploy dir.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Deploy Cayambe Ear</B><BR>
<BR>
Copy the cayambe.ear file into your deploy dir!!!
<BR>
<BR>
You should now be ready to go!<BR>
FYI: By default the cart war mounts to / and the admin war mounts to /admin
